        <p>
            I was born in Sao Paulo, Brazil. I  moved to Florida like a year and 5 months ago, and i graduated in South Broward high school. At this moment, i am in my first semester as a freshman at ByuH,
             and i am really enjoying this opportunity to be here at Byuh. In addition, i love to play basketball, and i love to surf! Even though i am learning.

            Also i am really interesting, and i am really enjoying python! I've bought a course in udemy to learn python a few months ago, and i learned a lot of fun things about coding. And, now i am here leearning html in this class! Which is also pretty good. I love it!
